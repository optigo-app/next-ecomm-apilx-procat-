        To be eligible for a return, your item must be unused and in the same

        packaging and should be returned the next day after receiving it.

        notify you that we have received your returned item. We will also notify
        you of the approval or rejection of your refund.

      <p>
        If you are approved, your refund will be processed, and a credit will

        If you haven’t received a refund yet, first check your bank account
        again. Then contact your credit card company, as it may take some time
        before your refund is officially posted. Next, contact your bank. There
        is often some processing time before a refund is posted.
