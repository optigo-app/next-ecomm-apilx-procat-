        <p>At US Creation, we strive to ensure a smooth and efficient shipping process for all our customers. Once an order is confirmed, we begin processing it to prepare for shipment. The estimated timeframe for processing and shipping is between 5 to 7 days from the date of order confirmation. This means that once your order has been successfully placed and verified, it will take approximately this duration before it is dispatched from our warehouse.</p>

        <p>Please note that this 5 to 7-day timeframe applies to business days only and does not include weekends or public holidays. If your order is placed on a Friday or right before a public holiday, processing will begin on the next working day. Additionally, there may be circumstances beyond our control, such as extreme weather conditions, supply chain disruptions, or carrier delays, that could affect shipping times. While we make every effort to adhere to the estimated timeframe, unforeseen situations may sometimes cause slight delays.</p>

        <p>Once your order has been shipped, you will receive a tracking number via email or SMS. This tracking number will allow you to monitor the status of your shipment in real time. You can use the provided tracking details to check the estimated delivery date and stay updated on your package’s journey. In case of any issues with tracking, please allow some time for the carrier to update the tracking information.</p>

        <p>If you have any questions or concerns regarding your shipment, our customer support team is available to assist you. Whether you need help tracking your order, updating your delivery address, or understanding shipping policies, we are here to ensure you have a seamless shopping experience. Please feel free to reach out to us via email, phone, or our online chat support for assistance.</p>

        <p>We appreciate your patience and understanding as we work to deliver your orders efficiently. Our goal is to provide a reliable and transparent shipping process, ensuring that you receive your products in a timely manner. Thank you for choosing  US Creation and we look forward to serving you!</p>
